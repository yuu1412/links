## Quickstart for GitHub Pages
>### Introduction
GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and published through GitHub. The quickest way to get up and running is by using the Jekyll Theme Chooser to load a pre-made theme. You can then modify your GitHub Pages' content and style.

This guide will lead you through creating a user site at `username.github.io.`

>### Creating your website

Enter `username.github.io` as the repository name. Replace username with your GitHub `username`. For example, if your username is octocat, the repository name should be `octocat.github.io`
